# Hello world, welcome to my git

- This git is from the discipline of AC
- This is my Remote Git
  
	**Today I will show to you guys, my Git, I'm not profissional yet, but I'll learn C#**

    1. What should I do?
        - Well, I don't know but I'm trying to figure it out.
        - Try to have better skills in this.

    This is my git, **enjoy it :)** (https://github.com/FredBacar2006/fredbacar)
